# Library App

## Features
Users are able to:
- Login or signup directly on the login screen
- Search, borrow, and return books once they are logged in
- Pay for any late penalties they have incurred through the interface.

All data is stored and retrieved from a SQL database.

## Tools
- Python
- Sqlite

## Run Instructions
To run the application, run the following command (Linux/MacOS):
```
python3 app/main.py <database_name>
```
A sample database is already provided called `library.db`.

***NOTE***: If you want to view the contents of the database I recommend you use a Sqlite extention in [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com).
